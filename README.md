# pi
This Drawing represents the PI number from an artist view : martin krzywinski. check his art :http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/pi/art/
the idea is to draw a circle, divid its edge into 10 parts each represnts a number : 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. 
then start reading the pi number starting from 3 (start draw a line from 3) into 1 (the end point of that line). then from 1 into 4 ..etc

it's implemented using: swift with SpriteKit.
